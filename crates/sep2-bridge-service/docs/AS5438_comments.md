# Implementation details for AS5438

## Overview

The AS5438 standard document (in draft as of 2026-08-31) describes the required
parameters for an inverter system to be interoperable with the energy grid. It
also provides explicit mappings for the CSIP-AUS, SunSpec Modbus and OCPP
protocols for the set of parameters.

In this crate, these mappings are used to translate parameters from CSIP-AUS to
SunSpec Modbus. However, some parameters are only loosely coupled and either require
some additional parameters to be set, or a decision on how to apply the values. This
file documents the choices made in this crate.

## Scaling factors (Tables E.1-12)

The SunSpec models contain scaling factors for many parameters. While not
explicitly mentioned in AS5438, it is a requirement that the modbus client reads
the scaling factors to interpret values obtained from reads and convert values
to write into the correct scale.

## Curve group assignments (Tables E.4, E.6-8)

When assigning to a curve, there is always a list of curve (or curve set, this
section will stick to the language of "curve" alone) options with up to `NCrv`
curves available. Each curve can support up to `NPt` points. The bridge service
will read these two constants when determining how to apply a curve. If `NPt`
is less than the length of the curve, then the bridge service will not apply the
curve at all and discard it.

If a model supports curves in the SunSpec definition, then it should also allow
at least 2 curves in the model. The first is for the active applied settings and
is readonly to the modbus client. The bridge service will not assume that
`NCrv >= 2` however, and test this constant, and discard a curve if this is not
true. The bridge service will always write to the curve in index 2 (the second curve).

The assignment of a curve is also required to assign `ActPt`, the number of
active points in the curve, which is allowed to be less than `NPt`. The
bridge service assigns the x,y points up to `ActPt` and does not assign data
points past this limit.

After assignment is complete, the bridge service writes `2` to `AdptCrvReq`
which requests the device take on the values in curve index 2. The bridge
service always uses index 2 and assumes that the device will either update its
settings based on updated values in the curve data points, or in response to a
write to `AdptCrvReq`: hence it always writes 2, even if it has previously
written 2 to `AdptCrvReq`.

A pedantic comment about the tables in AS5438: the points mentioned vary from
table to table in the length of the curve and the choice of index. It is assumed
that AS5438 simply means "a set of curve data points with x and y values" for
each of these tables.

## Table E.6

This table references model 706 for one point but 705 for the others. It is
assumed this is a typo and the curve applies only to model 706.

## Table E.9 (section E.4.7)

The frequency droop SunSpec group is a repeating group `711.Ctl`. This follows a
similar pattern to the curve group assignment but will be repeated here for
completeness.

The first element of the repeating group is a readonly value for the current
settings of the device. The parameters are choosen to be assigned to the second
element of the repeating group, if the model allows it (`711.NCtl` at least 2).
If the model doesn't allow it, the parameters are dropped.

In addition `711.Ena` is required to be set to enabled/disable if the frequency
droop is passed or not, and `711.AdptCtlReq` is assigned 2 after the `Ctl` group
data has been updated.

## Table E.12 (section E.4.10)

The SunSpec parameter `WSetMod` is not mentioned in the table. This parameter
is intended to switch between percentage (`W_MAX_PCT`) and Watts (`WATTS`). We
choose to set `WSetMod=W_MAX_PCT` when `WSetPct` is provided.

## Tables F.3-10

In many parameters in these tables, only `DERControl::X` is mentioned. To be
pedantic, these settings exist on the `DERControlBase` object which can be
specified through either a `DERControl` or a `DefaultDERControl`. In this
crate, the appropriate value is derived through layering a set of scheduled
`DERControl`s and a set of `DefaultDERControl`s using the primacy ordering
specified in the CSIP-AUS spec.

## Table F.2 (section F.3)

The connection status is given two targets, `DERStatus::genConnectStatus` and
`DERStatus::storConnectStatus`. While AS5438 describes these as parmeters to be
read, we are using them to report to the CSIP-AUS server which is out of scope
for AS5438. We assign the measured value from SunSpec `701.ConnSt` to both
`DERStatus::genConnectStatus` and `DERStatus::storConnectStatus`.

## Extension parameters

In addition to those specified in the appendices of AS5438 we also support some
more parameters:
- Set active power in Watts: `opModTargetW` -> `WSet`
- Readings of power for 3-phase: (SunSpec `701.WL1`, etc...).
